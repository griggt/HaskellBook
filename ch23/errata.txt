exercise #5

using GHCi 8.8.3

needs parentheses:

  Prelude> runState f >> f 0

Prelude Control.Monad.Trans.State> runState f >> f 0

<interactive>:89:15: error:
    * Couldn't match expected type `Integer -> s -> b'
                  with actual type `StateT Integer m0 ()'
    * The function `f' is applied to one argument,
      but its type `StateT Integer m0 ()' has none
      In the second argument of `(>>)', namely `f 0'
      In the expression: runState f >> f 0
    * Relevant bindings include
        it :: s -> b (bound at <interactive>:89:1)

Prelude Control.Monad.Trans.State> runState (f >> f) 0
